First, I need to understand what each of these entities is based on the provided search results. \n\nStarting with Fartcoin. The search results mention it's a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. From [1], it's described as combining humor, community engagement, and crypto. The total supply is 69,420,000 FARTCOIN tokens, which is a funny number, typical for meme coins. The initial distribution involved submitting fart-themed memes or jokes, which is unique. Also, there's a Gas Fee system with fart sounds, adding to the humor. They use an AI called Terminal of Truth for community interaction. \n\nLooking at [2], it confirms Fartcoin is a meme-based crypto on Solana, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. [1] says 69 million, [2] says 1 billion. Hmm, need to check which is correct. The user's query is about their role in crypto/web3, so maybe the total supply isn't the main point. \n\nMoving to [3], Capital.com states FARTCOIN has a max supply of 1 billion, launched in October 2024. That's conflicting with [1]. Maybe different sources have different info. Since [3] is from Capital.com, a reputable source, and [1] is from Bitget, perhaps the 1 billion is accurate. But the user's query is about their role, so maybe focus on the features rather than the exact supply. \n\nFartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results. Wait, the query asks about FartCoinOfSOL. The search results don't mention this entity. The user might have a typo or confusion. Let me check again. The search results only talk about Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Maybe FartCoinOfSOL is a community or a project related to Fartcoin? Since it's not in the search results, I can't provide info on it. The user might have intended to ask about Fartcoin and another entity, but since there's no data, I should focus on Fartcoin and mention that FartCoinOfSOL isn't covered in the provided sources. \n\nSo, the answer should explain Fartcoin's role in crypto/web3, highlighting its meme-driven approach, community engagement through humor, the Gas Fee system with fart sounds, and the AI Terminal of Truth. Also, note that FartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results, so no info is available. \n\nNeed to structure this concisely, using the key points from the search results. Make sure to cite the sources properly. Since the user wants precision and conciseness, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on the unique aspects: meme culture, community-driven, AI integration, and the humorous transaction features. \n\nAlso, check the dates. The current date in the scenario is February 2025, and the search results go up to January 2025. The latest info is from [3] and [4], which are January 2025. The market cap in [3] is $1.54 billion, which is a significant figure. \n\nIn summary, Fartcoin is a meme coin leveraging humor and community to engage users, using Solana's blockchain for efficiency. The lack of info on FartCoinOfSOL means it's either a typo or a separate entity not covered here. The answer should clarify that and focus on Fartcoin's role.\n</think>\n\nFartcoin (FARTCOIN) is a meme cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain, blending humor, community engagement, and blockchain technology. It uses fart-themed jokes and memes to foster interaction, with features like a **Gas Fee system** that triggers digital fart sounds during transactions[1][2]. The project incorporates an AI-driven framework called **Terminal of Truth** to generate creative content and engage users[1][4]. Launched in October 2024, it reached a market capitalization of $1.54 billion by January 2025, driven by viral social media campaigns and a community-driven approach[3][5].  \n\n**FartCoinOfSOL** is not mentioned in the provided search results, suggesting it may be a misreference or unrelated entity. Fartcoin’s role in crypto/web3 centers on demonstrating how meme culture and humor can drive adoption and community participation, even without traditional utility[1][4][5].",

First, I need to understand what each of these entities is based on the provided search results. \n\nStarting with Fartcoin. The search results mention it's a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. From [1], it's described as combining humor, community engagement, and crypto. The total supply is 69,420,000 FARTCOIN tokens, which is a funny number, typical for meme coins. The initial distribution involved submitting fart-themed memes or jokes, which is unique. Also, there's a Gas Fee system with fart sounds, adding to the humor. They use an AI called Terminal of Truth for community interaction. \n\nLooking at [2], it confirms Fartcoin is a meme-based crypto on Solana, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. [1] says 69 million, [2] says 1 billion. Hmm, need to check which is correct. The user's query is about their role in crypto/web3, so maybe the total supply isn't the main point. \n\nMoving to [3], Capital.com states FARTCOIN has a max supply of 1 billion, launched in October 2024. That's conflicting with [1]. Maybe different sources have different info. Since [3] is from Capital.com, a reputable source, and [1] is from Bitget, perhaps the 1 billion is accurate. But the user's query is about their role, so maybe focus on the features rather than the exact supply. \n\nFartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results. Wait, the query asks about FartCoinOfSOL. The search results don't mention this entity. The user might have a typo or confusion. Let me check again. The search results only talk about Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Maybe FartCoinOfSOL is a community or a project related to Fartcoin? Since it's not in the search results, I can't provide info on it. The user might have intended to ask about Fartcoin and another entity, but since there's no data, I should focus on Fartcoin and mention that FartCoinOfSOL isn't covered in the provided sources. \n\nSo, the answer should explain Fartcoin's role in crypto/web3, highlighting its meme-driven approach, community engagement through humor, the Gas Fee system with fart sounds, and the AI Terminal of Truth. Also, note that FartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results, so no info is available. \n\nNeed to structure this concisely, using the key points from the search results. Make sure to cite the sources properly. Since the user wants precision and conciseness, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on the unique aspects: meme culture, community-driven, AI integration, and the humorous transaction features. \n\nAlso, check the dates. The current date in the scenario is February 2025, and the search results go up to January 2025. The latest info is from [3] and [4], which are January 2025. The market cap in [3] is $1.54 billion, which is a significant figure. \n\nIn summary, Fartcoin is a meme coin leveraging humor and community to engage users, using Solana's blockchain for efficiency. The lack of info on FartCoinOfSOL means it's either a typo or a separate entity not covered here. The answer should clarify that and focus on Fartcoin's role.\n</think>\n\nFartcoin (FARTCOIN) is a meme cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain, blending humor, community engagement, and blockchain technology.

    topic: "Analyzing Fartcoin (FartCoinOfSOL):\nPrice: $0.8175 (-15.14%) | \nMCap: $821.81M (-14.56%) | \nVol: $425.07M (+80.77%) | \n105,088 holders (+6.55%) | \nMindshare: 8.82 (+5.42%) | \n60,537 followers (477 smart) | \nAvg Engagements: 476.9 (+19.82%)\n\nContext: <think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about Fartcoin and FartCoinOfSOL. First, I need to understand what each of these entities is based on the provided search results. \n\nStarting with Fartcoin. The search results mention it's a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. From [1], it's described as combining humor, community engagement, and crypto. The total supply is 69,420,000 FARTCOIN tokens, which is a funny number, typical for meme coins. The initial distribution involved submitting fart-themed memes or jokes, which is unique. Also, there's a Gas Fee system with fart sounds, adding to the humor. They use an AI called Terminal of Truth for community interaction. \n\nLooking at [2], it confirms Fartcoin is a meme-based crypto on Solana, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. [1] says 69 million, [2] says 1 billion. Hmm, need to check which is correct. The user's query is about their role in crypto/web3, so maybe the total supply isn't the main point. \n\nMoving to [3], Capital.com states FARTCOIN has a max supply of 1 billion, launched in October 2024. That's conflicting with [1]. Maybe different sources have different info. Since [3] is from Capital.com, a reputable source, and [1] is from Bitget, perhaps the 1 billion is accurate. But the user's query is about their role, so maybe focus on the features rather than the exact supply. \n\nFartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results. Wait, the query asks about FartCoinOfSOL. The search results don't mention this entity. The user might have a typo or confusion. Let me check again. The search results only talk about Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Maybe FartCoinOfSOL is a community or a project related to Fartcoin? Since it's not in the search results, I can't provide info on it. The user might have intended to ask about Fartcoin and another entity, but since there's no data, I should focus on Fartcoin and mention that FartCoinOfSOL isn't covered in the provided sources. \n\nSo, the answer should explain Fartcoin's role in crypto/web3, highlighting its meme-driven approach, community engagement through humor, the Gas Fee system with fart sounds, and the AI Terminal of Truth. Also, note that FartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results, so no info is available. \n\nNeed to structure this concisely, using the key points from the search results. Make sure to cite the sources properly. Since the user wants precision and conciseness, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on the unique aspects: meme culture, community-driven, AI integration, and the humorous transaction features. \n\nAlso, check the dates. The current date in the scenario is February 2025, and the search results go up to January 2025. The latest info is from [3] and [4], which are January 2025. The market cap in [3] is $1.54 billion, which is a significant figure. \n\nIn summary, Fartcoin is a meme coin leveraging humor and community to engage users, using Solana's blockchain for efficiency. The lack of info on FartCoinOfSOL means it's either a typo or a separate entity not covered here. The answer should clarify that and focus on Fartcoin's role.\n</think>\n\nFartcoin (FARTCOIN) is a meme cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain, blending humor, community engagement, and blockchain technology. It uses fart-themed jokes and memes to foster interaction, with features like a **Gas Fee system** that triggers digital fart sounds during transactions[1][2]. The project incorporates an AI-driven framework called **Terminal of Truth** to generate creative content and engage users[1][4]. Launched in October 2024, it reached a market capitalization of $1.54 billion by January 2025, driven by viral social media campaigns and a community-driven approach[3][5].  \n\n**FartCoinOfSOL** is not mentioned in the provided search results, suggesting it may be a misreference or unrelated entity. Fartcoin’s role in crypto/web3 centers on demonstrating how meme culture and humor can drive adoption and community participation, even without traditional utility[1][4][5]."

    topic: "Analyzing Fartcoin (FartCoinOfSOL):\nPrice: $0.8175 (-15.14%) | \nMCap: $821.81M (-14.56%) | \nVol: $425.07M (+80.77%) | \n105,088 holders (+6.55%) | \nMindshare: 8.82 (+5.42%) | \n60,537 followers (477 smart) | \nAvg Engagements: 476.9 (+19.82%)\n\nContext: <think>\nOkay, let's tackle this query about Fartcoin and FartCoinOfSOL. First, I need to understand what each of these entities is based on the provided search results. \n\nStarting with Fartcoin. The search results mention it's a meme coin on the Solana blockchain. From [1], it's described as combining humor, community engagement, and crypto. The total supply is 69,420,000 FARTCOIN tokens, which is a funny number, typical for meme coins. The initial distribution involved submitting fart-themed memes or jokes, which is unique. Also, there's a Gas Fee system with fart sounds, adding to the humor. They use an AI called Terminal of Truth for community interaction. \n\nLooking at [2], it confirms Fartcoin is a meme-based crypto on Solana, with a total supply of 1 billion tokens. Wait, there's a discrepancy here. [1] says 69 million, [2] says 1 billion. Hmm, need to check which is correct. The user's query is about their role in crypto/web3, so maybe the total supply isn't the main point. \n\nMoving to [3], Capital.com states FARTCOIN has a max supply of 1 billion, launched in October 2024. That's conflicting with [1]. Maybe different sources have different info. Since [3] is from Capital.com, a reputable source, and [1] is from Bitget, perhaps the 1 billion is accurate. But the user's query is about their role, so maybe focus on the features rather than the exact supply. \n\nFartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results. Wait, the query asks about FartCoinOfSOL. The search results don't mention this entity. The user might have a typo or confusion. Let me check again. The search results only talk about Fartcoin (FARTCOIN). Maybe FartCoinOfSOL is a community or a project related to Fartcoin? Since it's not in the search results, I can't provide info on it. The user might have intended to ask about Fartcoin and another entity, but since there's no data, I should focus on Fartcoin and mention that FartCoinOfSOL isn't covered in the provided sources. \n\nSo, the answer should explain Fartcoin's role in crypto/web3, highlighting its meme-driven approach, community engagement through humor, the Gas Fee system with fart sounds, and the AI Terminal of Truth. Also, note that FartCoinOfSOL isn't mentioned in the search results, so no info is available. \n\nNeed to structure this concisely, using the key points from the search results. Make sure to cite the sources properly. Since the user wants precision and conciseness, avoid unnecessary details. Focus on the unique aspects: meme culture, community-driven, AI integration, and the humorous transaction features. \n\nAlso, check the dates. The current date in the scenario is February 2025, and the search results go up to January 2025. The latest info is from [3] and [4], which are January 2025. The market cap in [3] is $1.54 billion, which is a significant figure. \n\nIn summary, Fartcoin is a meme coin leveraging humor and community to engage users, using Solana's blockchain for efficiency. The lack of info on FartCoinOfSOL means it's either a typo or a separate entity not covered here. The answer should clarify that and focus on Fartcoin's role.\n</think>\n\nFartcoin (FARTCOIN) is a meme cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain, blending humor, community engagement, and blockchain technology. It uses fart-themed jokes and memes to foster interaction, with features like a **Gas Fee system** that triggers digital fart sounds during transactions[1][2]. The project incorporates an AI-driven framework called **Terminal of Truth** to generate creative content and engage users[1][4]. Launched in October 2024, it reached a market capitalization of $1.54 billion by January 2025, driven by viral social media campaigns and a community-driven approach[3][5].  \n\n**FartCoinOfSOL** is not mentioned in the provided search results, suggesting it may be a misreference or unrelated entity. Fartcoin’s role in crypto/web3 centers on demonstrating how meme culture and humor can drive adoption and community participation, even without traditional utility[1][4][5]."
