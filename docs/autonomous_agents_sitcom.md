## Overview

### Problem Statement
Autonomous agent conversations in a sitcom format currently suffer from:
- Conversations loop and become repetitive due to lack of narrative progression
- Characters lose context and coherence across interactions
- No structured way to advance plot or maintain story arcs
- Difficulty balancing natural conversation flow with narrative goals
- Risk of hallucination where agents go off-topic or contradict established facts

### Product Vision
Create a lightweight story management system that enables multiple autonomous agents to engage in coherent, progressive conversations while maintaining character consistency and advancing narrative goals in an entertaining sitcom format focused on crypto discussions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Core Features
   - Story state tracking system
   - Phase-based conversation progression
   - Character participation monitoring
   - Topic adherence verification
   - Scene timing and pacing control

2. User Interactions
   - Director agent controls story flow
   - Character agents maintain personality while progressing plot
   - Natural conversation transitions between phases
   - Clear scene start/end markers

3. System Behaviors
   - Prevent conversation loops
   - Ensure balanced character participation
   - Maintain topic relevance
   - Progress through narrative phases
   - Time-box scene duration

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Performance
   - Scene completion within 5 minutes
   - Real-time agent responses
   - Minimal latency between interactions

2. Reliability
   - Consistent character behavior
   - Stable conversation flow
   - Graceful handling of off-topic responses

3. Security
   - Character knowledge boundaries
   - Topic containment
   - Appropriate content filtering

4. Scalability
   - Support for 4+ simultaneous agents
   - Multiple concurrent scenes
   - Extensible story arc system

## Design Decisions

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. Story State Management
   - Options considered: Complex state machine vs. Simple phase tracking
   - Selected approach: Lightweight phase-based system
   - Rationale: Reduces complexity while maintaining narrative control
   - Trade-offs: Less granular control but more natural conversation flow

2. Character Coordination
   - Options considered: Centralized vs. Distributed control
   - Selected approach: Director agent with character autonomy
   - Rationale: Balances narrative control with character authenticity
   - Trade-offs: Some spontaneity loss for better coherence

### Technical Specifications

1. Technology Stack
   - Frontend: Existing character card system
   - Backend: Story state management system
   - Integration: Director agent coordination

2. Integration Requirements
   - Character card compatibility
   - Message system integration
   - State persistence
   - Event tracking
